## File Types

### Version Controlled (Shared)

These files are in Git and shared across all projects:

- `common/` - Common guidelines applicable to all projects
- `steering-examples/common/` - Templates for project-specific files

### Project-Specific (Gitignored)

These files are generated by the installer and customized per project:

- `language.md` - Language settings (chat, docs, comments)
- `structure.md` - Project structure (AWS or default)
- `project.md` - Project-specific standards
- `tech.md` - Project-specific technical details

## Usage

### For New Projects

Run the installer, which will:
1. Copy `.kiro/` directory
2. Generate `language.md` based on your choices
3. Generate `structure.md` based on hosting platform
4. Create placeholder `project.md` and `tech.md`

### Customization

Edit the generated files to match your project:

```bash
# Edit project-specific files
vim .kiro/steering/project.md
vim .kiro/steering/tech.md
vim .kiro/steering/structure.md
vim .kiro/steering/language.md
```

### Common Guidelines

The `common/` directory contains shared guidelines:
- These are version controlled
- Apply to all projects
- Should not be modified per-project
- Override with project-specific files when needed

## Precedence

When there are conflicts, project-specific files take precedence:

```
project.md > common/project.md
tech.md > common/tech.md
structure.md > common/structure.md
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep common/ generic** - Only include universally applicable guidelines
2. **Customize project files** - Add project-specific details to generated files
3. **Don't commit generated files** - They're in .gitignore for a reason
4. **Update templates** - Improve steering-examples/common/ based on learnings
5. **Document decisions** - Use project.md to record important decisions
